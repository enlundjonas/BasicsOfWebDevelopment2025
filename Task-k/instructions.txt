2️⃣ Form Structure & Fields
The order form must be built using semantic HTML (<form>, <label>, etc.) and include at least the following fields:

1. Customer information ✅
-Full name (text)  ✅
-Email address (type email) ✅
-Phone number (type tel) ✅


2. Rental details (the following are examples)
-Item to rent: ✅
    -A <select> dropdown with options that match your catalog items (same or similar names). ✅
-Rental period:
    -Start date (type date) ✅
    -End date (type date) or number of days (type number) ✅
-Quantity (type number, with sensible min and maybe max) ✅


3. Additional info & consent
-Free text area (type textarea) for message / special wishes. ✅
-Checkbox to accept terms and conditions (e.g., “I accept the rental terms and privacy policy”). ✅
-Optional: Another checkbox such as “Subscribe to newsletter”.✅


4.Submit 
-A clear submit button, e.g., “Send order request” or “Submit rental request”.✅


    You are not required to implement a backend.
    The form can:
    Either send data to a dummy URL (e.g. action="thanks.html"), or ✅
    Be used just for HTML/JS validation practice without real submission.


3️⃣ Validation & UX (Validation is optional!)
-Use HTML5 validation attributes:
    -'required' for fields that must be filled in.✅
    -'type="email"' for email.✅
    -'type="tel"' and/or pattern for phone number (if you want a specific format).✅
    - min, max, step for numeric values (e.g., quantity, number of days).✅
    - min on type="date" inputs to prevent past dates (optional).✅

-Make sure:
    -Each input has a clear label describing what is expected.✅
    -The error messages are understandable for normal users.✅

-Optional (extra quality):
    -Use JavaScript to show custom error messages below the inputs.
    -Highlight invalid fields with a subtle border/background.


4️⃣ Visual Consistency
-Use the same CSS/Tailwind setup as your Landing and Catalog pages:✅
    -Same color palette.
    -Same fonts and general typography rules.
    -Same button styles, spacing, and card feel.
-The form should feel like a natural extension of your existing site:✅
    -Align content with the same max width, padding, and layout grid.
    -On small screens, the layout must be responsive (form should be easy to use on mobile).


5️⃣ Semantics & Accessibility
-Use semantic HTML:✅
    -<main> for main content.
    -<section> for different logical parts (intro, form, etc.).
    -<h1>, <h2>, … with a logical heading hierarchy.
-For the form:✅
    -Use <label for="..."> paired with id on inputs.
    -Group related fields using <fieldset> and <legend> where appropriate (e.g., rental period, customer info).
-Make sure:✅
    -Focus states are visible (keyboard users can see where they are).
    -Contrast is sufficient between text and background.
    -Button text is descriptive (avoid “Click here”; prefer “Submit rental request”).

6️⃣ Tech Choices
-You may use:
    -Plain CSS (external stylesheet), or
    -Tailwind CSS, reusing your existing setup.
-The code must be:
    -Cleanly formatted.
    -HTML-valid — use the W3C HTML Validator before submission.
